Description: This project use Huffman algorithm to encode several source files and decode
those encoded files based on a frequency file. The encode and decode algorithm are included
in the HuffmanSubmit.java file. Any output will be written to the files executed within the
HuffmanSubmit.java file.

Files included: encode and decode method: HuffmanSubmit.java

Reference: the way to implement the encode and decode method has been briefly reviewed from
"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/huffman-coding-greedy-algo-3/" and instructions from the
textbooks provided in the course.
